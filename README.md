In this project, I attempted to apply reinforcement learning, recognizing that while Q-learning may not represent the optimal model, it serves as the foundation for my exploration within the context of my current research project. However, this model exhibits several serious flaws that I aim to address in future iterations. Firstly, it currently relies solely on short-term rewards, leading to occasional entrapment in local minima. To rectify this issue, I plan to implement long-term rewards, granting the agent a significant reward every 10-20 moves. Additionally, I seek to develop a more effective strategy for managing epsilon.

The change I would like to do : 
                                1. Long term-rewards. [for every 10-20 moves, agent will get a long-term reward]
                                2. better strategy for epsilon.
